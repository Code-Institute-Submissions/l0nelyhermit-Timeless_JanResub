# Timeless - A Passionate Community Forum Focused On Watches
## Third Project : Data-Centric Development Milestone Project
A live demo of this project can be viewed [here](https://timeless-project-3.herokuapp.com/). 

This project utilizes a hybrid combination of single-page application elements as well as multi-page-application elements to bring out the full capabilities of a forum with high functionality.In addition, you may use the dummy account to access the website to see additional functionalities that are only available to registered users.

Dummy User Account
- Username: sroscampd@hc360.com
- Password: slamdunk9

### Disclaimer
Posts and listings populated by the various users as seen on the forum  are mainly used for the presentation of the demo.Therefore, the users that were being used are the different accounts that I have made to used to populate the forum and are not actual users of the forum. 

## UI/UX
### Strategy
#### User Stories
Watch Collectors:
1. Have meaningful discussions and share information about watches with other watch collectors
2. Make a listing and be able to sell their watches to other users

Gift Buyers:
1. Gain information on how to purchase a watch as a gift for others
2. Make deals with other users on purchasing a watch

Site Owner's Goals:
1. To provide a warm community environment for users to be able to interact with each other and exchange information
2. Provide a platform for users to sell their watches to other users

Proposed Solution:
Create a dynamic forum that would allow different types of users to be have the ability to post and market their watches online.

### Structure
![SiteMap](readme/timeless-sitemap.jpg)

Taking inspiration from a hub-and-spoke design, the website is designed in a way that would allow all users to be able to navigate through the site easily as well as for clear organisation of website content.

Sequence of Navigation
1. **Welcome Page**

### Flask
The web framework used in the development of the webpage that is reponsible for the key essential features such as routing, validation of forms and implementing key functions of the webpage. 

### Flask-Login
Used to provide basic security and privacy features and to enable an account login system.

### Visual Design
1. Toastr
- Used to inform the user on the result of an action on the webpage such as submission of a form
2. AOS Animation
- Used to enhance the visual display of the welcome page to give users a good first impression.
3. Bootstrap 
- Used to layout and design the page with custom bootstrap settings in place
4. Summernote
- Allows users to customize their posts,listings or comments with the tools available in the toolbar.However, this is a feature that has yet to be implemented.
5. BeautifulSoup
- Takes in the input of the summernote and converts it to raw text.
6. Google Fonts
- To enhance the overall display of the webpage
7. Cloudinary
- To allow users to upload images for their listings

### Security
1. passlib
- Allows for encryption for passwords
2. python-dotenv
- Prevents senstive information from being uploaded to github

### Library Tools
1. country_list
- Used to extract a list of available countries to be used as a select form field.

### Backend Tools
1. Pymongo
- Used to interact with MongoDB database 
2. dnspython
- Used for establishment of connection to MongoDB database


## Programming Methodology
### Form Validation
Upon submission of a form, there will be validation in place that is handled through condition checkers. An error accumulator which is a dictionary is used to store the errors and if the error accumulator has received errors, the user will be notified through a danger toastr message of a failed form submission.

### Security Control
- Through the use of .env file, important and sensitive data such as secret keys are carefully hidden away so that they are not leaked into the publc.
- Passlib library is used to encrypt passwords when the password is saved into the database to prevent unauthorized personnel from retrieving the passwords easily upon access to the database

### Source Control
- Github is used to track and manage any changes in the development of the project

## Database Design
### ER Diagram
![ERDiagram](readme/ER-Diagram-Timeless.png)

### Data Model Design For MongoDB
For this project, a hybrid approach was taken and a mixture of embedded data was used together with referencing to allow for the relationships to be established.

In general, embedded data was used to establish the one-to-many relationships such as the posts and comments, while referencing was used as well for profile and account.

### Responsiveness
Using the inspector function of Google Chrome, the following devices was used in the testing phase for mobile responsiveness:
- Moto G4
- Galaxy S5
- Pixel 2
- Pixel 2 XL
- iPhone 5/SE
- iPhone 6/7/8
- iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
- iPhone X
- IPad
- Ipad Pro

In the testing of responsiveness to both phone and tablet devices, the webpage application is able to display and layout the correct intended design for the different
pages when tested through these different platforms.
